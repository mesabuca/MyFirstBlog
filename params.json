We will learn how is programming on Ubuntu. Actually I do not know but we will learn it together.\r\n\r\n#Let's Learn How is pragramming on Ubuntu\r\n##What should we know :\r\n-What is 'gcc'\r\n-Text editor\r\n-Software Language Education Book\r\n-What is Terminal\r\n-And working zeal\r\n\r\n##Why Gcc :\r\nOf course there is compiler as CodeBlock MonoDevolop but we will use gcc because it's faster then the others and other compilers show where is the problem it makes you lazy but if you exercise with gcc you can be better devoloper. \r\n\r\n##Downloading Gcc :\r\nThere are many shortcut on ubuntu. One of them is Ctrl + Alt + T this is going to open terminal. \r\n`sudo apt-get update`\r\n`sudo apt-get install gcc`\r\nThats all. \r\n\r\n##Starting : \r\nI'm gonna use terminal's text editor (nano) because it seems cool :D and also you can use Gedit sublime etc.. writing `nano test.c` it'll open a new c file and also you can open already existed file.\r\nThere are many libraries on c we will use stdio.h library for starting. When ours code is done we will press Ctrl+X save and exit.\r\n`gcc -o 'test' 'test.c'` it'll compiling your codes.\r\n`./test` it'll run your program.\r\n##Steps:\r\n1-Hello World in C\r\n2-Variables in C\r\n3-Input/Output in C\r\n\r\n#### To be continued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
